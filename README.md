# webview
A simple and practical all-in-one web browsing tool. Features include the current year, month, day, and time; multi-search; monitor size measurement; bookmarks; clock; and calendar.

Clear, logical, and simple structure.

Images are converted to BASE64. Operates on a single page.
To reduce load, the clock's second hand has been omitted.

Input values are retained during screen transitions without using any cookies or LocalStorage.

Using this as a base enables rapid creation of various specialized tools (multi-search sites, countdowns, schedule management, etc.).
